# Production-Optimization-Using-Linear-Programming-PuLP-
This project applies linear programming using the PuLP library to optimize resource allocation in a small manufacturing unit. It determines the ideal number of products to produce to maximize profit under labor-hour and material constraints, demonstrating model formulation, solution, and insights.
